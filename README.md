# Alpha Sprint Comments
Majority of the bugs related to this sprint were on the database itself. Updating init.sql or heroku.sql itself does nothing, you must log into the databse and make all ALTER commands in there. Ali had issues connecting to the database that could not be resolved. Regardless of issues, we got a better grasp of the functionality from a lot of debugging.
